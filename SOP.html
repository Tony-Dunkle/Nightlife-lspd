                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 pl-4">
                                <li><strong>High Command:</strong> Responsible for the strategic direction, long-term planning, and overarching policy formulation of the department.</li>

Bypassing ranks is generally prohibited, as this structure ensures efficient resolution of issues at the appropriate level and prevents higher leadership from being unduly burdened with routine concerns. Adherence to the Chain of Command is paramount for maintaining departmental integrity, operational efficiency, and overall functionality. Failure to follow established channels may result in formal disciplinary action, including the issuance of strike points.</p>
