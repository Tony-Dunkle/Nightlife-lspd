The actions and behavior of individual officers directly reflect upon the entire department and its reputation. Any instance of misconduct, whether internal or external, will be subject to a thorough investigation and may result in a range of disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment or referral to criminal authorities. Strict accountability shall be applied to all actions undertaken by department personnel.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Life preservation is paramount. Officers can honor reasonable demands for hostage safety. Harm to hostages due to poor negotiation may lead to disciplinary action. SWAT typically manages high-risk scenes; otherwise, the highest-ranking officer commands. Suspect requests (e.g., "no AIR1") must be adhered to. After departure, debrief hostages, inspect scene, secure area, and file report.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-1">2.1.2 Hostage Negotiation Basics</h4>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Initial restraint with handcuffs. Miranda Rights read immediately after cuffing and before questioning. Downed suspects (after shots fired): GSR test, Terry frisk if positive, full search if weapons found. Move suspect to safe location for medical aid. Shackles for flight risk.

Prohibited for non-critical situations, off-duty, or when standard communication suffices. Misuse results in disciplinary action.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-1">2.3.3 Matched firepower</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Officers match suspect force with minimum necessary. Class 1/2 weapons (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, illegal mods): respond with Class 1 sidearm. Class 2 SMGs/Rifles or Class 3 weapons (fully auto/high-powered rifles): respond with Class 3 weapons. Firepower should not escalate beyond neutralizing immediate threat.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-2">2.4 Radio Usage</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">All transmissions start with officer's sign. Messages brief, precise, professional. Remain on primary dispatch channel unless reassigned. Prioritized traffic: pursuits, confirmed shots fired, robbery in progress, officer in danger. Wait for pauses. Idle conversation reserved for non-radio means.</p>
