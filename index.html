            <p>
                This action has been taken due to the unfortunate state of the FiveM server, <strong class="text-white">Nightlife RP</strong>. The server has devolved into an environment where management's conduct has become unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issues are numerous and severe, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside bg-gray-900/50 p-4 rounded-md space-y-2 border border-gray-700">
                <li>Systematic abuse of position by members of the management team.</li>
                <li>Inappropriate monitoring and stalking of players.</li>
                <li>Silencing and removal of community members who voice dissent or opposing viewpoints.</li>
                <li>Inconsistent and biased enforcement of rules, where select individuals are permitted to abuse their powers while others face punishment for minor infractions, such as spawning a weapon or healing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This toxic environment is enabled by an ownership that appears disconnected from the server's daily operations, allowing these issues—perpetrated by their own girlfriend and others in power—to continue without accountability.
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-white mt-6">
                For these reasons, this website will no longer support or be affiliated with Nightlife RP.
